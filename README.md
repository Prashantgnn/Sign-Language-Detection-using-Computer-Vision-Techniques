# Sign-Language-Detection-using-Computer-Vision-Techniques
The Sign Language Recognition System aims to provide an efficient and accurate way to 
convert sign language into text or audio. The application processes the image and converts 
it into its respective alphabet.
Tools used:  OpenCV, CVZone Hand Tracking Module, Google Teachable Machine.

STEPS TO FOLLOW :-

This project is a computer vision based project which aims to provide a medium for the people with hearing impairement.
The data is created using the datacapture.py module by creating a set of directories beforehand according to the destination address.
On Collecting the data use the google teachable machine paltform to train the tensorflow.js model for prediction
implement the tfjs model in a bootstrap template to complete the project
